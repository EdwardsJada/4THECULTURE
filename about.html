      <p>4THECULTURE is a digital space created to honor and uplift the Black artists who have shaped music, challenged norms, and redefined culture. This platform exists to spotlight not just their creative achievements, but their social impact, business ventures, activism, and ongoing influence in communities around the world.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:12px">Often, the deeper contributions of Black artists are overlooked or overshadowed by their commercial success. 4THECULTURE aims to shift that narrative by telling the full story — the story behind the sound. Whether through detailed profiles, fan engagement, or curated content, this site celebrates the power, resilience, and artistry that continues to move the culture forward.</p>

      <p style="margin-top:12px">Created by someone passionate about representation and legacy, this platform was built with intention: to inform, inspire, and empower. While the creator remains behind the scenes, the purpose is front and center — to amplify Black voices and ensure their stories are preserved, celebrated, and respected.</p>
